        <li><strong><u>Goals:</u></strong></li>
        <p>
            The main short term goal I have is getting a job at a decent company. With Iowa State's education,
            this should not be too hard. Everything that we have learned over the last four years has prepared us
            for this moment. Right now I am not limiting myself for what kind of work I will be doing. My main
            interest right now is big data analytics.
            <br><br>
            My main long term goal is to climb the ladder at the company I am with. Get into some interesting work
            that is hopefully on the more cutting edge of computer science.

        <li><strong><u>General Education Beyond the Technical Aspect:</u></strong></li>
        <p>
            General education classes have played a large role in much of my work. All of the group project classes,
            like Com S 309 and Com S 329, helped teach us team dynamics and leadership. Other classes went into
            technical detail like how operating systems work, or how to write thread safe code. These technical classes
            usually made up for lack of real world experience by having some sort of presentation. For example, in Com S
            430, we learn to write synchronized code in Java along with having each student do a presentation on a real
            world topic involving synchronization.

            Com S 309:
            I learned to work with a team in this course. I had never had any web programming experience, and I ended
            up leaning a lot from my more experienced team members. In a more economic context, I leaned about project
            management, and how to organize a large software project. This will help which ever company I work for make
            money because we will have higher quality projects being produced.
            <br><br>
            Com S 329:
            In this course, we had four quarter long projects of our team of four's choosing. The goal of the course
            was to teach us about project management. By learning how to handle a large project, we will be able to
            help our companies produce higher quality products. This makes more money for the company as well as
            ourselves for the achievement. In a social context, we got to work in a team and further our leaning of
            team dynamics. Our team worked well together and got projects finished quickly. The most valuable team
            dynamic I learned was how to schedule meetings. Everyone is busy and there si little time where we are all
            available. We had to talk it out and figure out how we were going to work as a team to develop our projects.
        </p>
        <li><strong><u>Experience with Economic/Social Context:</u></strong></li>
        <p>
            The economic impact of my work so far has been building up my portfolio to eventually get a good job making
            money. Other than that, there was no economic impact that these projects held. The social impact was way
            more important. I got to learn how to work on a team and how to lead a team. Ever team I have been on at
            ISU, I have learned a great deal about team dynamics. This will be extremely useful because most of my
            career as a Software Engineer, I will be working on a team.
