                    <li><i>Description:</i> My team and I won 1st place for best healthcare app at the hackathon in Fall
                        2016. When we started the hackathon, it was at first
                        hard to come up with a good idea. I wanted to do something with healthcare,
                        so I decided we should just make a virtual hospital. With the time allotted, we
                        produced a server that monitored patients and their billing. We fully
                        implemented the monitors on patients to notify people on their contact list,
                        whether it was family or the doctor, by phone and email. We then began making the
                        billing which was not finished.

                    <li><i>Experience Gained:</i> I gained a lot of teamwork skills. We had to pull together
                        a complicated project within 36hours. We effectively designed and had a working demo
                        in those 36hours. I also got a lot of JavaScript experience particularly with how
                        NodeJS works.

                    <br>
                    <li><i>Description:</i> In this project, we focused on making a server that hosted virtual gaming
                        consoles. The back end was written in java and used glassfish as a protocol. Cordova
                        is a multi-platform app building application that allowed us to use JavaScript and then
                        build it into an iOS or Android app. For the front-end, we used DART with the react/flux
                        architecture. The games were built on top of the fornt-end, so they were also written in
                        DART. It could run multiple game groups in which each had clients connected that displayed the
                        the game for the users, and phone controllers to play the game even multiplayer.

                    <br>
                    <li><i>Experience Gained:</i> My role was the game developer. I got to work a lot with DART. The
                        game I made was a 2D, super nintendo, zelda like game. I learned how react works and
                        got my first web-developing experience here.

                    <li><i>Description:</i> In this project, we used NodeJS and the web-worker system to distribute out
                        calculations for a genetic algorithm that calculates efficient drone delivery routes.
                        The drones have constraints that can be sent in such as max weight, max number of packages,
                        batter power, etc. Then the path would be shown on a 2D map.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Experience Gained:</i> For this project, I used the d3 library in JavaScript to display the
                        marks
                        to deliver to, and the route itself. I was also in the process of making some run-time
                        statistics to show how our algorithm short-cutted the traveling salesman problem. We only
                        had 2 weeks for this project, so this did not get completed.

                    <br>
                    <li><i>Description:</i> In this project, we used a NodeJS server to run an attendance tracker
                        for teachers or professors in the school system. The app ran in a web browser and
                        connected to a camera. The camera would be pointed at the doorway for the entrance
                        to the classroom. If a new student came through, it would make a new record for them
                        in the database. If the system recognizes them, there attendance is marked in the
                        database.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li><i>Experience Gained:</i> We had only 2 weeks to complete this project, so many time management
                        skills were gained. In this project, I got to further my web-developing skills. We
                        used a facial recognition library called Kairos that was really nice software for
                        facial recognition. I also got to learn about a database called firebase.
