            <dd>
                Iowa State University has done a very good job in preparing me for Software Engineering.
                Most of the classes were very interesting and fun to complete. The project design classes,
                like Com S 309 and Com S 329, helped show me how to design a software system. Other classes
                like Com S 311 and Com S 430 have helped me solve complicated engineering processes, like dealing
                with debugging synchronization bugs, to prepare me for problem solving. It is clear that Iowa State
                University has close ties with many great companies to give us students presentations. This shows
                me insight into the real world so to speak.

            </li>
            <dd>
                The group project classes were probably the most valuable. I got to work in groups for a semester
                to design what ever we would like for the most part. There were design guidelines in the class that
                mimics real world design processes and documents. There is a certain level of professionalism you
                must keep in these classes because you meet weekly with an advisor to discuss your work sort of like
                a client in the working world.

                <dt><strong><u>Outside Research:</u></strong></dt>
            </li>
            <dd>
                If I had to use any outside research, it was usually to clarify something I did not understand in the
                lecture. I would usually use google and find videos on YouTube to help explain the topic in a fresh way.

            </li>
            <dd>
                There are two main outside activities that I participated in. The first was the ISU Hack-a-thon in Fall
                2016. This was an amazing experience. Learned leadership skills and won first place for health care.
                The second was the Career Fair. This is the most important event because it links us students to
                employers
                that want students from Iowa State University. Both events helped me foresee what I needed to prepare
                for
                in future working environments.

                <dt><strong><u>Taking Risk and Applying Skills:</u></strong></dt>
            </li>
            <dd>
                The main way I have gotten to apply my skills is through the Hack-a-thon. I have not gotten any
                internships
                yet so this is the only other event. I am always looking for projects to work on with friends because I
                am
                confident in my ability to program, but everyone is still busy with school.

                <dt><strong><u>What Would I Change:</u></strong></dt>
            </li>
            <dd>
                If I had to redo my undergraduate experience again, I would not change all to much. I think the classes
                laid out in the program currently make sense and were very valuable to me. The only thing that I would
                like to see is more project classes like Com S 309. I really learned a lot in that class, and I think
                students would benefit form more classes like it.
