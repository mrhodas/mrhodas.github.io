        <dd>
            We will create an intuitive iOS application for tracking veterinary medical information for cattle farmers.
            This application will help our clients record and monitor medical treatment and recovery information for
            their animals and facilitate data-driven analysis and decision making to help our users make more informed
            economic and medical decisions.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Goals:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a simple and intuitive user interface and data entry model that is easy to learn and painless
                    to use in the field
                </li>
                <li>Develop methods of communication with the existing Performance Beef database systems in order to use
                    and improve the information made available to our clients
                </li>
                <li>Build a information review system from synthesized data that allows our clients to make more
                    effective and informed decisions about their animal health
                </li>
            </ul>

        <dt><strong><u>My Contribution:</u></strong></dt>
        <dd>
            First off, our entire team started with no experiance developing in swift with iOS. There was a lot of
            research involved. Eventually when we started really developing an app, I helped create separate medication
            lists for each user. I also am working on converting the Firebase database to the client's SQL web service.

        <dt><strong><u>Project Significance:</u></strong></dt>
        <dd>
            This project has taught me many new ways to approach app development. Since developing an app was completely
            new to me, I gained the skill to connect an app to any of my other programming. I also can now develop an
            application for iOS. This project was also significant because we did such a good job, the client offered us
            summer internships.
